* delete blank line
- if current line is blank line, it will not be deleted, but all the
  previous/later blank lines will all be deleted
- if current line is not blank line, then only later blank lines will be deleted

* delete duplicate line
deletes the first duplicate line it encounters, starting from the top.
NOTE: lines don't have to be sorted

* clear the highlight
one way I find is to use command *M-x hi-lock-mode*
* set the major mode for file
Use auto-mode-alist to associate a major mode with file name extension.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; setup files ending in “.js” to open in js2-mode
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.js\\'" . js2-mode))

| keys    | function                                           |
|---------+----------------------------------------------------|
| C-<SPC> | set a mark                                         |

* minibuffer
** close the minibuffer (applicable to ivy)
C-g
** quickly clear the minibuffer for input
C-S-Del
* custom input mode
use =C-\= to start choose different input mode.
for eg, choose *Tex* you can use =\lambda= to
get λ.

If you don't know how to type a character, you can copy and paste it from
somewhere else then type *C-u C-x =* to get extended character info for the
character at point.
* grep recursively
find-grep-dired
