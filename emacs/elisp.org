* save to clipboard(kill ring)
kill-new
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(kill-new "hello")
#+END_SRC

* get the clipboard content
there are two steps involved:
** save the clipboard content to kill-ring
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(yank)
#+END_SRC
** get the top of kill-ring
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(substring-no-properties (current-kill 0))
#+END_SRC
substring-no-properties is need to remove the format information.

or 
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(substring-no-properties (car kill-ring))
#+END_SRC
* delete item from list
for eg, I don't want ffip to exclude the pdf file for searching:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq ffip-prune-patterns (delete "*.pdf" ffip-prune-patterns))
#+END_SRC
* delete the top entry of kill-ring
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(pop kill-ring)
#+END_SRC
