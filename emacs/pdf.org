* pdf-tools
probably best available for emacs in terms of pdf.
https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools

it requires some work to make it work on mac, easier on Linux.
** setup on Mac (for spacemacs)
first install *zlib* and other dependencies (require homebrew):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew install poppler automake
brew install zlib
#+END_SRC

next is add *pdf-tools* into the spacemacs layers, then re-load emacs.

then find the pdf-tools package in *.emacs.d*, it would sth like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd /Users/xyz/.emacs.d/elpa/pdf-tools-20170417.150/build/server
#+END_SRC

then change *PKG_CONFIG_PATH* since zlib is installed at different location (adjust according to zlib version): 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
#+END_SRC

finally build pdf-tools:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make -s
#+END_SRC

restart emacs and it should work.

tested on macOS Sierra
