* ssh into virtual guest from host
setup port forwarding in the network settings.

host ip: 127.0.0.1
host port: 2222
guest ip: find out guest ip using ifconfig after logging in
guest port: 22

then use command like this:
ssh -X -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1

* shared folder
the location of shared folder inside guest OS(ubuntu) is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/media/sf_<share name>
#+END_EXAMPLE

it should has been auto mounted, if not, do this(assume we want to mount to
~/share):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo mount -t vboxsf <shared folder name> ~/share/
#+END_SRC

but first time very likely to encounter error like *permission denied*.
The root cause is the user doesn't belong to this *vboxsf* group.

so do this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo adduser <username> vboxsf
#+END_SRC

but need to *reboot* the guest os before it can take effect.
